## Dont laugh at me

This is my firt time working with web app development or  however it is called, so I will have to go small step by small step.

Ill first start working with svelte, then nestJS and then prisma or whatever, dont expect great thing from here.

Since Im not the smartest dude around here, to run the server I have to type "cd app && npm run dev", thanks


## TODO NESTJS

Install Daysy and Tailwind for svelte

Ionmi me ha dicho que haga un CRUD
aprender los  comandos de nest js (sobre todo usar --no-spec para que no haga los files de testeo)
